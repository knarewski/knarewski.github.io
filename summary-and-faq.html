    <h2>Summary and FAQ</h2>
    <p>Thanks to following the flow, the git history looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>b363e19 Add support for custom greeting; ref GRTR-5224
b2e301c Fix style; ref GRTR-5224
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead of that:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bf1cd4e Make the custom greeting backward compatible; ref GRTR-5224
3b6271c Freeze string literals; ref GRTR-5224
b363e19 Add support for custom greeting; ref GRTR-5224
b2e301c Fix style; ref GRTR-5224
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="q-why-not-just-squash-all-the-commits-into-one-when-merging">Q: Why not just squash all the commits into one when merging?</h4>
<p>A: Git history is a powerful tool which helps understanding past changes, including the authorâ€™s reasoning and scope of change. Mixing preparatory changes like style fixing, adding missing test coverage and performing initial refactor makes it much harder to use.</p>

<h4 id="q-what-if-i-need-to-revert-a-feature">Q: What if I need to revert a feature?</h4>
<p>A: Thanks to rebase strategy, all the new commits are next to each other in git history, which allows to revert range of commits using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git revert OLDER_COMMIT^..NEWER_COMMIT</code></p>

<h4 id="q-is-it-really-worth-the-effort">Q: Is it really worth the effort?</h4>
<p>A: For me it is, the flow may feel a bit complex at the beginning, but it gets natural with time. The most difficult bit is squashing conflicts, sometimes it is better to just be pragmatic and add a new commit on top.</p>

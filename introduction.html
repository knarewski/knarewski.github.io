    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is an opinionated guide for contributing effectively.</p>

<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make it easy to perform a thorough Code Review</li>
  <li>create clean, linear and useful commit history</li>
  <li>make it possible to find the business origin of every commit</li>
</ul>

<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the company uses GitHub or similar platform with the concept of Pull Requests (GitHub specific hints are marked with “😺”)</li>
  <li>branch is being worked on by one person at a time (because in certain cases we’ll rewrite history)</li>
  <li>the company uses a ticketing system (not a hard requirement, but there are some tips around that area)</li>
</ul>
